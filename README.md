# CaloriesBurntPredictor

# Overview #
This project is a Calories Burnt Predictor developed using machine learning techniques in Python. The predictor estimates the number of calories burned during physical activities based on various input parameters such as duration, type of activity, age, weight, and gender.

# Features #
Predicts calories burnt for a wide range of physical activities.
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy over time.
Supports customization based on user-specific parameters.
Provides easy-to-understand predictions through a user-friendly interface.

# Requirements #
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

# Installation #
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/calories-burnt-predictor.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd calories-burnt-predictor
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage #
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.
Run the calories_burnt_predictor.py script:
python calories_burnt_predictor.py
Follow the instructions provided in the command-line interface to input the required parameters such as duration, type of activity, age, weight, and gender.
The predictor will then generate an estimate of the calories burnt during the specified activity.

# Dataset #
The predictor was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing information about various physical activities and the corresponding calories burnt. The dataset was collected from reliable sources and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and reliability.

# Contribution #
